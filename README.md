# Pure Data Mixer

A stereo mixer built in Pure Data, and the abstractions needed to make your own.

## Dependencies

* iemlib
* else
* mrpeach
* iemguts
* zexy

## Installation

Install Pure Data Vanilla (other flavors may work, but have not been tested), install the dependencies, download the repository (recommended way is to download it via Git, although downloading an archive shouldn't cause any problems), and open `mixer.pd`.
